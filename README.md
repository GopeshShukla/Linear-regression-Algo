Linear Regression Algorithm:-

This project demonstrates a linear regression model that predicts a student's potential performance based on the number of hours they study. By using this model, we can estimate the percentage a student might achieve given their study time.

Project Overview:-

Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that finds the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this case, the model predicts a student's score (dependent variable) based on the hours they study (independent variable).

Key Features:-

Simple linear regression model implementation
Input: Number of study hours
Output: Predicted percentage score
Dataset: Real or synthetic data for student study hours and corresponding scores
Model training, testing, and evaluation

How It Works:-

The model fits a straight line to the dataset of study hours and scores. The line is used to predict future performance based on the input study hours. By analyzing the slope of the line, we can understand the correlation between the variables.
